You can try installing the provided apk file and check the WiFi security.
App Overview:
WiFi Secure Scanner is a simple and lightweight Android app that helps you check how safe your current WiFi connection is — and also tells you if you’re using a VPN. It’s built to keep you informed about your network security and offers useful tips to stay protected while browsing online.

Key Features:

WiFi Security Detection:
The app scans your current WiFi network to check if it’s using strong, secure encryption like WPA2 or WPA3.
If you're connected to an outdated or open network like WEP or public WiFi with no password, the app will warn you, so you can avoid risky connections.

VPN Detection:
It can tell if a VPN is active — whether you're on WiFi or mobile data.
If a VPN is running, it lets you know your internet traffic is encrypted and your online activity is safer.

 Real-time Status Scan:
 When you open the app or hit “Rescan,” it shows a quick animation as it checks your connection.
Once the scan is complete, you’ll see a clear, color-coded message about your network:
Green: Safe WiFi or VPN detected
Red: Open or insecure network detected

Security Tips & Recommendations
The app includes helpful advice for staying safe on public networks.
It even suggests trusted VPNs like ProtonVPN, NordVPN, and Surfshark if you want extra protection.

Location Awareness:
To properly check your WiFi security, the app needs access to your device’s location.
If GPS is off, it’ll prompt you to turn it on — don’t worry, your location isn't stored or shared.
